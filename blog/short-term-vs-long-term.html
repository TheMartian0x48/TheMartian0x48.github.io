      <h1>Fast vs Mature learning style</h1>

<p>I prefer to learn in a longer period rather than a shorter period. one of the things I learned from my under-graduation test preparation. I used to spend only a few days preparing for my exams. I did get a good grade but I didn't learn many things. I have learned my lessons. Now I learn a little each day.</p>

<p>Since technology is changing very fast and there is so much to learn, it is important to differentiate between what I call '<strong>Fast learning style</strong>' and '<strong>Mature learning style</strong>'.</p>

<p>What I mean by the <strong>Fast learning style</strong> is that you spend a short amount of time learning some topic and expect that you would be good at that topic. On the other hand, you spent a long time on the same topic which I call '<strong>Mature learning style</strong>'.</p>

<p>Shallow knowledge about a topic is a good thing as it will help you to quickly learn about that topic in the future. But using shallow knowledge to build something serious is like 'shooting your leg with your toothbrush and expected bleeding'. The <strong>Fast learning style</strong> builds shallow knowledge. </p>

<p>Since I'm learning a good thing about software development. I'm gonna use <strong>the DRY</strong> principle here and will point to blogs that argue why learning in a short time is bad idea.</p>

<h2>Teach Yourself Programming in 23 Hours</h2>

<p>This is the blog written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood">Jeff Atwood</a>. He is one of the founders of the famous website <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. In one of his comments, he posted this art published on <a href="http://abstrusegoose.com/249">Abstruegoose</a>, which I think is a very funny and interesting way to convey the message.</p>
